Given an integer n, find the total possible number of bit strings of length n which don't have two contiguous zeroes in them. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

The required number is actually the n+2 th Fibonacci number. This program calculates Fibonnaci numbers using a O(LogN) method involving memoization DP.
